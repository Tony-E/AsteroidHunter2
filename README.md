Search for moving objects in Slooh.com FITS images.

The objective is to scan groups of FITS images that have been acquired using Slooh.com telescopes and detect moving objects.

The program employs a "synthetic tracking" approach whereby groups of images are stacked and tracked at different 
motions and position angles in the hope that faint objects will be revealed.
